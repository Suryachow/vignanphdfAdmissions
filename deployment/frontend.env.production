# --- PRODUCTION FRONTEND ENV ---
# Location: Instance 1 (Local Build)

# Because Instance 1 handles the proxying via Nginx,
# the frontend should point to ITS OWN Public IP or Domain.
# Nginx will then forward these requests to the Backend Instance 2.

VITE_API_URL=/ 
# Using "/" works if the frontend and backend share the same domain/IP 
# via the Nginx proxy we just configured.
